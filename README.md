# SnailURL
A free-to-use website with which you can create redirect links of various types, including a link that requires a password to redirect, a link that redirects to different places based on who the user is, and a link that displays a message and does not redirect.

### URL Parameters
In a URL, there are often parameters.  For example, if on pretendExampleSite.com you want to set "color" to 5 and "id" to "something", the URL may look something like this: `pretendExampleSite.com/?color=5&id=something`.

The URL parameters for this website go as follows:
| Parameter | What | Example |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| m | Message to display | `?m=Hello` |
| r | Redirect link | `?r=earth.google.com/web` |
| c | Background color (top) | `?c=#c0ffc0` |
| C | Background color (bottom) | `?C=#00ff00` |
